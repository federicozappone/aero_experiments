# CFD Code and Snippets

This repository contains some personal code and implementations of various CFD tools for simulating a number of different flows.\
Most of the scripts can be used out of the box, some files only contains pieces of code or functions stored here for future self reference.\
The vast majority of the lines of code are also documentented.\
Keep in mind (if you decide to use this code) that these formulations are greatly simplified and may not be as accurate as needed for your specific project.
